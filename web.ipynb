It improves sputum rheology by hydrating mechanism leading to liquefaction of mucus in the lumen of respiratory tract, thus facilitating expectoration of mucus and reducing dyspnea. It stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells, thus contributing to the lowering of superficial tension in the alveoli. It also reduces bronchial hyperactivity. Ambroxol has anti inflammatory properties owing to the inhibitory effect on the production of cellular cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites. In patients with COPD it traditionally improves airway patency.

Smooth muscle is a type of muscle that is not under voluntary control; it is the muscle present in places such as the gut and uterus. Alverine Citrate acts directly on the muscle in the gut, causing it to relax. This prevents the muscle spasm which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Alverine Citrate also relaxes the smooth muscle in the uterus. It is therefore also used to treat painful menstruation, which is caused by muscle spasm in the uterus (dysmenorrhea).

Smooth muscle is a type of muscle that is not under voluntary control; it is the muscle present in places such as the gut and uterus. Alverine Citrate acts directly on the muscle in the gut, causing it to relax. This prevents the muscle spasm which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Alverine Citrate also relaxes the smooth muscle in the uterus. It is therefore also used to treat painful menstruation, which is caused by muscle spasm in the uterus (dysmenorrhea). Dosage & Administration Adult: Orally: 60-120 mg 1-3 times daily. * রিজস্টাড িচিকৎসেকর পরামশ মাতােবক ঔষধ সবন করুন' Interaction There are no drug interactions reported with this medicine.

It is effective in the prevention of stress ulceration and GI bleeding. It acts as an antiflatulent to alleviate the symptoms of gas including post operative gas pain. This rapidly relieves acid pain, disperses gastric foam and facilitates eructation of gas and air. * রিজস্টাড িচিকৎসেকর পরামশ মাতােবক ঔষধ সবন করুন' Composition Each tablet contains- Dried Aluminium Hydroxide Gel BP (Al2O3, 47% minimum): 425.53 mg Magnesium Hydroxide BP: 400 mg Simethicone USP: 30 mg\\n\\nBP: 400 mg Simethicone USP: 30 mg Each 5 ml contains- Aluminium Oxide (Equivalent amount of Aluminium Hydroxide Gel USP): 200 mg Magnesium Hydroxide (Equivalent amount of Magnesium Hydroxide Paste USP): 400 mg Simethicone USP: 30 mg Pharmacology This is the mixture of non-systemic acid neutralizing substances and antiflatulent. This preparation offers reliability as well as long action. Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces. Dosage & Administration Tablet: 1-2 tablets 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.Suspension: 1-2 teaspoonful 1-3 hours after meal and at bedtime or as directed by the physician. * রিজস্টাড িচিকৎসেকর পরামশ মাতােবক ঔষধ সবন করুন' Interaction All antacids may increase or decrease the rate and/or extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs.

This rapidly relieves acid pain, disperses gastric foam and facilitates eructation of gas and air. * রিজস্টাড িচিকৎসেকর পরামশ মাতােবক ঔষধ সবন করুন' Composition Each tablet contains- Dried Aluminium Hydroxide Gel BP (Al2O3, 47% minimum): 425.53 mg Magnesium Hydroxide BP: 400 mg Simethicone USP: 30 mg Each 5 ml contains- Aluminium Oxide (Equivalent amount of Aluminium Hydroxide Gel USP): 200 mg Magnesium Hydroxide (Equivalent amount of Magnesium Hydroxide Paste USP): 400 mg Simethicone USP: 30 mg Pharmacology This is the mixture of non-systemic acid neutralizing substances and antiflatulent. This preparation offers reliability as well as long action. Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces. Dosage & Administration Tablet: 1-2 tablets 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.Suspension: 1-2 teaspoonful 1-3 hours after meal and at bedtime or as directed by the physician. * রিজস্টাড িচিকৎসেকর পরামশ মাতােবক ঔষধ সবন করুন' Interaction All antacids may increase or decrease the rate and/or extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs.

Precautions & Warnings Influ should not be discontinued abruptly in patients with Parkinson's disease since a few patients have experienced a parkinsonian crisis, i.e., a sudden marked clinical deterioration, when this medication was suddenly stopped. The dose of anticholinergic drugs or of Influ should be reduced if atropine-like effects appear when these drugs are used concurrently. Abrupt discontinuation may also precipitate delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression and slurred speech. Overdose Effects Deaths have been reported from overdose with Influ. The lowest reported acute lethal dose was 1 gram. Because some patients have attempted suicide by overdosing with Influ, prescriptions should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management.Acute toxicity may be attributable to the anticholinergic effects of Influ. Drug overdose has resulted in cardiac, respiratory, renal or central nervous system toxicity. Cardiac dysfunction includes arrhythmia, tachycardia and hypertension. Pulmonary edema and respiratory distress have been reported; renal dysfunction including increased BUN, decreased creatinine clearance and renal insufficiency can occur. Central nervous system effects include insomnia, anxiety, agitation, aggressive behavior, hypertonia, hyperkinesia, ataxia, gait abnormality, tremor, confusion, disorientation, depersonalization, fear, delirium, hallucinations, psychotic reactions, lethargy, somnolence and coma. Seizures may be exacerbated in patients with prior history of seizure disorders. Hyperthermia has also been observed.There is no specific antidote for an overdose of Influ. However, slowly administered intravenous physostigmine in 1 and 2 mg doses in an adult at 1- to 2-hour intervals and 0.5 mg doses in a child at 5- to 10-minute intervals up to a maximum of 2 mg/hour have been reported to be effective in the control of central nervous system toxicity caused by Influ. For acute overdosing, general supportive measures should be employed along with immediate gastric lavage or induction of emesis. Fluids should be forced, and if necessary, given intravenously. The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of Influ. Since the excretion rate of Influ increases rapidly when the urine is acidic, the administration of urine acidifying drugs may increase the elimination of the drug from the body. The blood pressure, pulse, respiration and temperature should be monitored. The patient should be observed for hyperactivity and convulsions; if required, sedation, and anticonvulsant therapy should be administered.

It is effective in the prevention of stress ulceration and GI bleeding. It acts as an antiflatulent to alleviate the symptoms of gas including post operative gas pain. This rapidly relieves acid pain, disperses gastric foam and facilitates eructation of gas and air. * রিজস্টাড িচিকৎসেকর পরামশ মাতােবক ঔষধ সবন করুন' Composition Each tablet contains- Dried Aluminium Hydroxide Gel BP (Al2O3, 47% minimum): 425.53 mg Magnesium Hydroxide BP: 400 mg Simethicone USP: 30 mg Each 5 ml contains- Aluminium Oxide (Equivalent amount of Aluminium Hydroxide Gel USP): 200 mg Magnesium Hydroxide (Equivalent amount of Magnesium Hydroxide Paste USP): 400 mg Simethicone USP: 30 mg Pharmacology This is the mixture of non-systemic acid neutralizing substances and antiflatulent. This preparation offers reliability as well as long action. Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces. Dosage & Administration Tablet: 1-2 tablets 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.Suspension: 1-2 teaspoonful 1-3 hours after meal and at bedtime or as directed by the physician. * রিজস্টাড িচিকৎসেকর পরামশ মাতােবক ঔষধ সবন করুন' Interaction All antacids may increase or decrease the rate and/or extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs.

      "\n",
      "*   **The User’s Query is Misinterpreted:** The user is asking about continuing *NAPA* for a fever. However, the text primarily discusses *Ambroxol Hydrochloride* (in Acorex syrup) and *Eromycin 3% Lotion*. There is no mention of \"NAPA\" in the provided documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Ambroxol Hydrochloride (Acorex) is Relevant for Fever Symptoms:** Acorex, containing Ambroxol Hydrochloride, *is* indicated for productive cough, which is a common symptom of fever and respiratory infections. It’s a mucolytic agent designed to help loosen and expel mucus, which can be beneficial when a fever is accompanied by a cough.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Important Considerations & Warnings:**\n",
      "    *   **Don’t Combine with Antitussives:** The text explicitly warns against taking Acorex simultaneously with antitussives like Codeine.  If phlegm is liquefied by Acorex, the expectoration might not occur, rendering the medication ineffective.\n",
      "    *   **Caution with Ulcers/Convulsions:**  Patients with gastric/duodenal ulcers or convulsive disorders should use Acorex cautiously.\n",
      "    *   **Allergic Reactions:**  Rarely, allergic responses (eruption, urticaria, angioneurotic edema) can occur.\n",

      "**Recommendation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the information provided, **it *might* be appropriate to continue using Acorex (Ambroxol Hydrochloride) for a fever *if* the fever is accompanied by a productive cough.** However, this recommendation is contingent on the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Confirm the Diagnosis:** Ensure the fever is due to a respiratory infection and not another condition.\n",
      "2.  **Avoid Antitussives:** Do not take Acorex with any cough suppressants.\n",
      "3.  **Consult a Healthcare Professional:** *Crucially*, the user should consult a doctor or pharmacist for a proper diagnosis and personalized advice.  Self-treating a fever can be risky.\n",
